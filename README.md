# Assignment-1-MAD
Assignment 1 for mobile application development, which includes its specifics tasks such as SRS document, Use Case diagram ,Class Diagram and front end code.
The App(Front end) runs on expo go (web or app),to make it work paste the code in snapexo.dev and connect to a device or run it on web.
The screenhots have the app's front end screenshots.
There are many changes in this repo,the reason for this is that at first i added the assignment files through git but my git was configured with my friend's name and email so while changing it, i unfortunately deleted the previous files and added different course files,resulting in many changes.
